The PowerShell script provided, named GraphAdminMembership.ps1, allows you to manage administrative units and user memberships using Microsoft Graph. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and executing the script to achieve these tasks.
Prerequisites

    Azure AD Application Setup:
        Register an application in the Azure portal to obtain the required Application ID.
        Generate a Client Secret for the application.
        Grant necessary permissions (User.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All) to the application.

    Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK:
        Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK using the following command:

        powershell

        Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph

Script Configuration

    Open the GraphAdminMembership.ps1 script in a text editor of your choice.

    Locate the following variables and replace the placeholders with your actual values:
        $tenantID: Your Azure AD Tenant ID.
        $applicationId: Your registered Azure AD Application ID.
        $clientSecret: The generated Client Secret for the application.

Running the Script

    Authentication:

        Open PowerShell on your computer.

        Navigate to the directory containing the script using the cd command, for example:

        powershell

cd C:\Path\To\Script

Run the script by typing its filename and pressing Enter:

powershell

        .\GraphAdminMembership.ps1

        The script will authenticate using the provided credentials and proceed with administrative unit management.

    Script Execution:
        The script performs the following steps:
            Authenticates to Microsoft Graph using the provided Azure AD application credentials.
            Checks for existing administrative units based on company names and creates them if necessary.
            Adds users to corresponding administrative units based on their company names.

    Monitoring Progress:
        Follow the script's output in the PowerShell console to monitor its progress.
        The script will provide messages indicating the creation of administrative units and the addition of users.

Limitations and Considerations

    The script assumes that user data is correctly structured with accurate company names for administrative unit organization.
    Enhance error handling, logging, and advanced error reporting for production use.
    The provided script does not handle updating or deleting administrative units, and it may need customization for more complex scenarios.
